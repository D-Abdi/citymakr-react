# CitymakR-react

Hello! This is the repository of the CityMakR table application. To get this up and running follow these steps: 

1. Open your terminal inside the blockdemo repository
2. Inside your terminal run: npm install
5. After installation, run: npm run start.

After these 5 steps a new window should open with a gray box covering your whole screen. Click around to see if it works. This window will likely be on the localhost URL, but this does not make it possible to connect to the server. Instead, navigate to your IP adress in the URL ending with the numbers of the port. Example: localhost:3000 means port = 3000. Change it to (Your IP):3000 (p.e. 127.0.0.1:3000).
